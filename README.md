This repository is intended to be used with files
emitted by the intrusion.py image format.

Copy images from one directory as they appear in it
Place them on a directory intended to host a website
At carefully chosen intervals regenerate the index.html etc
using imageindex to produce the index.html etc
The latter operation is expensive and we avoid doing it
too frequently and when files are still moving
